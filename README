stupidparser - A simple arithmetic expression parser and evaluator.

It uses the Top Down Operator Precedence algorithm for parsing.  For more
information, see parse.py.

What i actually wanted to write is a scheme compiler, but i wrote this first,
because if i can't hack this, a scheme compiler is out of the question.

Inaccurate specification:
 An expression is a number or expression operator expression
  or function '(' expression ')'.
 A number is 1 or more digits.
 A function is a name.
 A name is a letter followed by 0 or more letters or digits.
 An operator is one of these: + / * % - or and not
